Time 0 to 227 - Person 2:
the judge today so we got you know we all got to see it but i mean you gotta read between the lines what do you think he actually ultimately wants to see happen here

Time 227 to 1028 - Person 3:
hurry area think first and foremost aaron he'd love to see the to speedy trial demands drawn but i don't think that's gonna happen alternatively i think he wants a little bit of our understanding of what's gonna happen with regard to the removal up in federal court i think that was probably his biggest concern that you know they might start a trial for everyone including their potential defend his it might have their case removed and then end up having to remove the case to federal court if that would happen adapt a causes some double jeopardy concerns i'm so i think that's his his biggest issue

Time 1028 to 1074 - Person 2:
is he doesn't want to start they are the other issue

Time 1074 to 1450 - Person 3:
is logistically when you're dealing with nineteen people i mean even trying to find a courtroom big enough to hold a trial like that is gonna be tricky but i mean you eat the other side of that is how them would you like to do this trial twice and each time probably going anywhere from nine months to a year

Time 1450 to 1498 - Person 2:
yeah i mean just to think about that and then
